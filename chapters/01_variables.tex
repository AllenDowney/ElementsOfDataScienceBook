\chapter{Variables and Values}\label{variables-and-values}}

The topics in this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Basic programming features in Python: variables and values.
\item
  Translating formulas from math notation to Python.
\end{itemize}

You don't need a lot of math to do data science, but and the end of this
chapter I'll review one topic that comes up a lot: logarithms.

\hypertarget{numbers}{%
\section{Numbers}\label{numbers}}

Python provides tools for working with many kinds of data, including
numbers, words, dates, times, and locations (latitude and longitude).
Let's start with numbers. Python can work with several types of numbers,
but the two most common are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \passthrough{\lstinline!int!}, which represents integer values like
  \passthrough{\lstinline!3!}, and
\item
  \passthrough{\lstinline!float!}, which represents numbers that have a
  fraction part, like \passthrough{\lstinline!3.14159!}.
\end{itemize}

Most often, we use \passthrough{\lstinline!int!} to represent counts and
\passthrough{\lstinline!float!} to represent measurements. Here's an
example of an \passthrough{\lstinline!int!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
3
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
3
\end{lstlisting}

When you run a cell that contains a value like this, Jupyter displays
the value. Here's an example of a \passthrough{\lstinline!float!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
3.14159
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
3.14159
\end{lstlisting}

\passthrough{\lstinline!float!} is short for ``floating-point'', which
is the name for the way these numbers are stored. Floating-point numbers
can also be written in a format similar to scientific notation:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
1.2345e3
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
1234.5
\end{lstlisting}

This value is equivalent to \(1.2345 \times 10^{3}\), so the result is
\passthrough{\lstinline!1234.5!}. The \passthrough{\lstinline!e!} in
\passthrough{\lstinline!1.2345e3!} stands for ``exponent''.

\hypertarget{arithmetic}{%
\section{Arithmetic}\label{arithmetic}}

Python provides operators that perform arithmetic. The operators that
perform addition and subtraction are \passthrough{\lstinline!+!} and
\passthrough{\lstinline!-!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
3 + 2 - 1
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
4
\end{lstlisting}

The operators that perform multiplication and division are
\passthrough{\lstinline!*!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!/!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
2 * 3
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
6
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
2 / 3
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
0.6666666666666666
\end{lstlisting}

And the operator for exponentiation is \passthrough{\lstinline!**!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
2 ** 3
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
8
\end{lstlisting}

Unlike math notation, Python does not allow implicit multiplication. For
example, in math notation, if you write \(3 (2 + 1)\), that's understood
to be the same as \(3 \times (2+ 1)\). In Python, that's an error.

NOTE: The following cell uses \passthrough{\lstinline!\%\%expect!},
which is a Jupyter ``magic command'' that means we expect the code in
this cell to produce an error.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
%%expect TypeError

3 (2 + 1)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
\end{lstlisting}

In this example, the error message is not very helpful, which is why I
am warning you now. If you want to multiply, you have to use the
\passthrough{\lstinline!*!} operator.

The arithmetic operators follow the rules of precedence you might have
learned as ``PEMDAS'':

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Parentheses before
\item
  Exponentiation before
\item
  Multiplication and division before
\item
  Addition and subtraction.
\end{itemize}

So in this expression:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
1 + 2 * 3
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
7
\end{lstlisting}

The multiplication happens first. If that's not what you want, you can
use parentheses to make the order of operations explicit:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
(1 + 2) * 3
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
9
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Exercise:} Write a Python expression that raises
\passthrough{\lstinline!1+2!} to the power
\passthrough{\lstinline!3*4!}. The answer should be
\passthrough{\lstinline!531441!}.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{math-functions}{%
\section{Math Functions}\label{math-functions}}

Python provides functions that compute mathematical functions like
\passthrough{\lstinline!sin!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!cos!},
\passthrough{\lstinline!exp!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!log!}.
However, they are not part of Python itself, but they are available from
a \textbf{library}, which is a collection of values and functions. The
one we'll use is called NumPy, which stands for ``Numerical Python'',
and is pronounced ``num pie''. Before you can use a library, you have to
\textbf{import} it. Here's how we import NumPy:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
import numpy as np
\end{lstlisting}

This line of code imports \passthrough{\lstinline!numpy!} as
\passthrough{\lstinline!np!}, which means we can refer to it by the
short name \passthrough{\lstinline!np!} rather than the longer name
\passthrough{\lstinline!numpy!}. Names like this are case-sensitive,
which means that \passthrough{\lstinline!numpy!} is not the same as
\passthrough{\lstinline!NumPy!}. So even though the name of the library
is NumPy, when we import it we have to call it
\passthrough{\lstinline!numpy!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
%%expect ModuleNotFoundError

import NumPy as np
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'NumPy'
\end{lstlisting}

This error message might be confusing if you don't pay attention to the
difference between uppercase and lowercase. But assuming we import
\passthrough{\lstinline!np!} correctly, we can use it to read the value
\passthrough{\lstinline!pi!}, which represents the mathematical constant
\(\pi\).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
np.pi
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
3.141592653589793
\end{lstlisting}

The result is a \passthrough{\lstinline!float!} with 16 digits. As you
might know, we can't represent \(\pi\) with a finite number of digits,
so this result is only approximate.

NumPy provides \passthrough{\lstinline!log!}, which computes the natural
logarithm

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
np.log(100)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
4.605170185988092
\end{lstlisting}

NumPy also provides \passthrough{\lstinline!exp!}, which raises the
constant \passthrough{\lstinline!e!} to a power.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
np.exp(1)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
2.718281828459045
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Exercise:} Use these functions to check the identity
\(\log(e^x) = x\). Mathematically, it is true for any value of \(x\).
With floating-point values, it only holds for values of \(x\) between
-700 and 700. What happens when you try it with larger and smaller
values?
\end{quote}

Floating-point numbers are finite approximations, which means they don't
always behave like math. As another example, let's see what happens if
we add up \passthrough{\lstinline!0.1!} three times:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
0.30000000000000004
\end{lstlisting}

The result is close to \passthrough{\lstinline!0.3!}, but not exact.
When you work with floating-point numbers, remember that they are only
approximately correct.

\hypertarget{variables}{%
\section{Variables}\label{variables}}

A \textbf{variable} is a name that refers to a value. The following
statement assigns the value \passthrough{\lstinline!5!} to a variable
named \passthrough{\lstinline!x!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
x = 5
\end{lstlisting}

The variable we just created has the name \passthrough{\lstinline!x!}
and the value \passthrough{\lstinline!5!}.

If we use \passthrough{\lstinline!x!} as part of an arithmetic
operation, it represents the value \passthrough{\lstinline!5!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
x + 1
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
6
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
x**2
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
25
\end{lstlisting}

We can also use a variable when we call a function:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
np.exp(x)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
148.4131591025766
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that the result from \passthrough{\lstinline!exp!} is a
\passthrough{\lstinline!float!}, even though the value of
\passthrough{\lstinline!x!} is an \passthrough{\lstinline!int!}.

\textbf{Exercise:} If you have not programmed before, one of the things
you have to get used to is that programming languages are picky about
details. Natural languages, like English, and semi-formal languages,
like math notation, are more forgiving.

As an example, in math notation, parentheses and square brackets mean
the same thing, you can write \(\sin (\omega t)\) or \(\sin [\omega t]\)
-- either one is fine. And you can leave out the parentheses altogether,
as long as the meaning is clear, as in \(\sin \omega t\). In Python,
every character counts. For example, the following are all different,
and only the first one works:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
np.exp(x)
np.Exp(x)
np.exp[x]
np.exp x
\end{lstlisting}

While you are learning, I encourage you to make mistakes on purpose to
see what goes wrong. Read the error messages carefully. Sometimes they
are helpful and tell you exactly what's wrong. Other times they can be
misleading. But if you have seen the message before, you might remember
some likely causes.

\textbf{Exercise:} The NumPy function that computes square roots is
\passthrough{\lstinline!sqrt!}. Use it to compute a floating-point
approximation of the golden ratio:

\(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\)

Hint: The result should be close to \passthrough{\lstinline!1.618!}.

\hypertarget{calculating-with-variables}{%
\section{Calculating with Variables}\label{calculating-with-variables}}

Now we'll use variables to solve a problem involving compound interest.
It might not be the most exciting example, but it uses everything we
have done so far, and it reviews exponentiation and logarithms, which we
are going to need.

If we invest an amount of money, \(P\), in an account that earns
compounded interest, the total accumulated value, \(V\), after an
interval of time, \(t\), is:

\(V=P\left(1+{\frac {r}{n}}\right)^{nt}\)

where \(r\) is the annual interest rate and \(n\) is the compounding
frequency. For example, if you deposit \$2,100 in a bank paying an
annual interest rate of 3.4\% compounded four times a year, we can
compute the balance after 7 years by defining these variables:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
P = 2100
r = 0.034
n = 4
t = 7
\end{lstlisting}

And computing the total accumulated value like this.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=source]
P * (1 + r/n)**(n*t)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
2661.6108980682593
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Exercise:} Continuing the previous example, suppose you start
with the same principle and the same interest rate, but interest is
compounded twice per year, so \passthrough{\lstinline!n = 2!}. What
would the total value be after 7 years? Hint: we expect the answer to be
a bit less than the previous answer.

\textbf{Exercise:} If interest is compounded continuously, the value
after time \(t\) is given by the formula:

\(V=P~e^{rt}\)

Translate this equation into Python and use it compute the value of the
investment in the previous example with continuous compounding. Hint: we
expect the answer to be a bit more than the previous answers.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

This chapter introduces variables, which are names that refer to values,
and two kinds of values, integers and floating-point numbers.

It presents mathematical operators, like \passthrough{\lstinline!+!} for
addition and \passthrough{\lstinline!*!} for multiplication, and
mathematical functions like \passthrough{\lstinline!log!} for logarithms
and \passthrough{\lstinline!exp!} for raising
\passthrough{\lstinline!e!} to a power.

In the next chapter, we'll see additional data types for representing
letters and words, dates and times, and latitude and longitude.
