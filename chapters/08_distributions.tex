\chapter{Distributions}\label{distributions}}

In this chapter we'll see three ways to describe a set of values:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A probability mass function (PMF), which represents a set of values
  and the number of times each one appears in a dataset.
\item
  A cumulative distribution function (CDF), which contains the same
  information as a PMF in a form that makes it easier to visualize, make
  comparisons, and perform some computations.
\item
  A kernel density estimate (KDE), which is like a smooth, continuous
  version of a histogram.
\end{itemize}

For examples, we'll use data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to
look at distributions of age and income, and to explore the relationship
between income and education.

But we'll start with one of the most important ideas in statistics, the
distribution.

\hypertarget{distributions-1}{%
\section{Distributions}\label{distributions-1}}

A distribution is a set of values and their corresponding probabilities.
For example, if you roll a six-sided die, there are six possible
outcomes, the numbers \passthrough{\lstinline!1!} through
\passthrough{\lstinline!6!}, and they all have the same probability,
\passthrough{\lstinline!1/6!}.

We can represent this distribution of outcomes with a table, like this:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\midrule()
Value & Probability \\
\midrule()
\endhead
1 & 1/6 \\
2 & 1/6 \\
3 & 1/6 \\
4 & 1/6 \\
5 & 1/6 \\
6 & 1/6 \\
\midrule()
\end{longtable}

More generally, a distributions can have any number of values, the
values can be any type, and the probabilities do not have to be equal.

To represent distributions in Python, we will use a library called
\passthrough{\lstinline!empiricaldist!}, for ``empirical distribution'',
where ``empirical'' means it is based on data rather than a mathematical
formula.

\passthrough{\lstinline!empiricaldist!} provides an object called
\passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!}, which stands for ``probability mass
function''. A \passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} object contains a set of
possible outcomes and their probabilities.

For example, here's a \passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} that represents the
outcome of rolling a six-sided die:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
from empiricaldist import Pmf

outcomes = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
die = Pmf(1/6, outcomes)
\end{lstlisting}

The first argument is the probability of each outcome; the second
argument is the list of outcomes. We can display the result like this.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
die
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\midrule
{} &     probs \\
\midrule
1 &  0.166667 \\
2 &  0.166667 \\
3 &  0.166667 \\
4 &  0.166667 \\
5 &  0.166667 \\
6 &  0.166667 \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}

A \passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} object is a specialized version of a
Pandas \passthrough{\lstinline!Series!}, so it provides all of the
attributes and methods of a \passthrough{\lstinline!Series!}, plus some
additional methods we'll see soon.

\hypertarget{the-general-social-survey}{%
\section{The General Social Survey}\label{the-general-social-survey}}

Now we'll use \passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} objects to represent
distributions of values from a new dataset, the General Social Survey
(GSS). The GSS surveys a representative sample of adult residents of the
U.S. and asks questions about demographics, personal history, and
beliefs about social and political issues. It is widely used by
politicians, policy makers, and researchers.

The GSS dataset contains hundreds of columns; using an online tool call
\href{https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/}{GSS Explorer} I've selected
just a few and created a subset of the data, called an \textbf{extract}.

Like the NSFG data we used in the previous chapter, the GSS data is
stored in a fixed-width format, described by a Stata data dictionary.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
dict_file = 'GSS.dct'
data_file = 'GSS.dat.gz'
\end{lstlisting}

We will use the \passthrough{\lstinline!statadict!} library to read the
data dictionary.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
from statadict import parse_stata_dict

stata_dict = parse_stata_dict(dict_file)
\end{lstlisting}

The data file is compressed, but we can use the
\passthrough{\lstinline!gzip!} library to open it.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
import gzip

fp = gzip.open(data_file)
\end{lstlisting}

The result is an object that behaves like a file, so we can pass it as
an argument to \passthrough{\lstinline!read\_fwf!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
import pandas as pd

gss = pd.read_fwf(fp, 
                  names=stata_dict.names, 
                  colspecs=stata_dict.colspecs)
gss.shape
(@\dashfill@)
@@@(64814, 8)@@@
\end{lstlisting}

The result is a \passthrough{\lstinline!DataFrame!} with one row for
each respondent, and one column for each variable. Here are the first
few rows.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
gss.head()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrrrr}
\midrule
{} &  YEAR &  ID\_ &  AGE &  EDUC &  SEX &  GUNLAW &  GRASS &  REALINC \\
\midrule
0 &  1972 &    1 &   23 &    16 &    2 &       1 &      0 &  18951.0 \\
1 &  1972 &    2 &   70 &    10 &    1 &       1 &      0 &  24366.0 \\
2 &  1972 &    3 &   48 &    12 &    2 &       1 &      0 &  24366.0 \\
3 &  1972 &    4 &   27 &    17 &    2 &       1 &      0 &  30458.0 \\
4 &  1972 &    5 &   61 &    12 &    2 &       1 &      0 &  50763.0 \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}

I'll explain these variables as we go along, but if you want more
information, you can read the online documentation at
\url{https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/vfilter}.

\hypertarget{distribution-of-education}{%
\section{Distribution of Education}\label{distribution-of-education}}

To get started with this dataset, let's look at the distribution of
\passthrough{\lstinline!EDUC!}, which records the number of years of
education for each respondent. First we'll select a column from the
\passthrough{\lstinline!DataFrame!} and use
\passthrough{\lstinline!value\_counts!} to see what values are in it.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
gss['EDUC'].value_counts().sort_index()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\midrule
{} &   EDUC \\
\midrule
0  &    165 \\
1  &     47 \\
2  &    152 \\
3  &    257 \\
4  &    319 \\
5  &    402 \\
6  &    828 \\
7  &    879 \\
8  &   2724 \\
9  &   2083 \\
10 &   2880 \\
11 &   3743 \\
12 &  19663 \\
13 &   5360 \\
14 &   7160 \\
15 &   2910 \\
16 &   8355 \\
17 &   1967 \\
18 &   2384 \\
19 &    920 \\
20 &   1439 \\
98 &     73 \\
99 &    104 \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}

The result from \passthrough{\lstinline!value\_counts!} is a set of
possible values and the number of times each one appears, so it is a
kind of distribution.

The values \passthrough{\lstinline!98!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!99!}
are special codes for ``Don't know'' and ``No answer''. We'll use
\passthrough{\lstinline!replace!} to replace these codes with
\passthrough{\lstinline!NaN!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
import numpy as np

educ = gss['EDUC'].replace([98, 99], np.nan)
\end{lstlisting}

We've already seen one way to visualize a distribution, a histogram.
Here's the histogram of education level.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

educ.hist(grid=False)
plt.xlabel('Years of education')
plt.ylabel('Number of respondents')
plt.title('Histogram of education level');
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_34_0.png}
\end{center}

Based on the histogram, we can see the general shape of the distribution
and the central tendency -- it looks like the peak is near 12 years of
education. But a histogram is not the best way to visualize this
distribution because it obscures some important details.

An alternative is to use a \passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!}. The function
\passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf.from\_seq!} takes any kind of sequence --
like a list, tuple, or Pandas \passthrough{\lstinline!Series!} -- and
computes the distribution of the values in the sequence.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
pmf_educ = Pmf.from_seq(educ, normalize=False)
type(pmf_educ)
(@\dashfill@)
@@@empiricaldist.empiricaldist.Pmf@@@
\end{lstlisting}

The keyword argument \passthrough{\lstinline!normalize=False!} indicates
that we don't want to normalize this PMF. I'll explain what that means
soon.

Here's what the first few rows look like.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
pmf_educ.head()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\midrule
{} &  probs \\
\midrule
0.0 &    165 \\
1.0 &     47 \\
2.0 &    152 \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}

In this dataset, there are \passthrough{\lstinline!165!} respondents who
report that they have had no formal education, and
\passthrough{\lstinline!47!} who have only one year. Here the last few
rows.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
pmf_educ.tail()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\midrule
{} &  probs \\
\midrule
18.0 &   2384 \\
19.0 &    920 \\
20.0 &   1439 \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}

There are \passthrough{\lstinline!1439!} respondents who report that
they have 20 or more years of formal education, which probably means
they attended college and graduate school.

You can use the bracket operator to look up a value in a
\passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} and get the corresponding count:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
pmf_educ[20]
(@\dashfill@)
@@@1439@@@
\end{lstlisting}

Usually when we make a PMF, we want to know the \emph{fraction} of
respondents with each value, rather than the counts. We can do that by
setting \passthrough{\lstinline!normalize=True!}; then we get a
\textbf{normalized} PMF, that is, a PMF where the values in the second
column add up to 1.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
pmf_educ_norm = Pmf.from_seq(educ, normalize=True)
pmf_educ_norm.head()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\midrule
{} &     probs \\
\midrule
0.0 &  0.002553 \\
1.0 &  0.000727 \\
2.0 &  0.002352 \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}

Now if we use the bracket operator, the result is a fraction. For
example, the fraction of people with 12 years of education is about
30\%:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
pmf_educ_norm[12]
(@\dashfill@)
@@@0.30420656899299164@@@
\end{lstlisting}

\passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} provides a \passthrough{\lstinline!bar!}
method that plots the values and their probabilities as a bar chart.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
pmf_educ_norm.bar(label='EDUC')

plt.xlabel('Years of education')
plt.xticks(range(0, 21, 4))
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.title('Distribution of years of education')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_48_0.png}
\end{center}

In this figure, we can see that the most common value is 12 years, but
there are also peaks at 14 and 16, which correspond to two and four
years of college.

For this data, the PMF is probably a better choice than the histogram.
The PMF shows all unique values, so we can see where the peaks are.
Because the histogram puts values into bins, it obscures these details.
With this dataset, and the default number of bins, we couldn't see the
peaks at 14 and 16 years. But PMFs have limitations, too, as we'll see.

First, here's an exercise where you can practice with PMFs.

\textbf{Exercise:} Let's look at the \passthrough{\lstinline!YEAR!}
column in the \passthrough{\lstinline!DataFrame!}, which represents the
year each respondent was interviewed.

Make an unnormalized \passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} for
\passthrough{\lstinline!YEAR!} and display the result. How many
respondents were interviewed in 2018?

\hypertarget{cumulative-distribution-functions}{%
\section{Cumulative Distribution
Functions}\label{cumulative-distribution-functions}}

Now we'll see another way to represent a distribution, the cumulative
distribution function (CDF). \passthrough{\lstinline!empiricaldist!}
provides a \passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} object that represents a CDF.
We can import it like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
from empiricaldist import Cdf
\end{lstlisting}

As an example, suppose we have a sequence of five values:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
values = 1, 2, 2, 3, 5  
\end{lstlisting}

Here's the \passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} of these values.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
Pmf.from_seq(values)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\midrule
{} &  probs \\
\midrule
1 &    0.2 \\
2 &    0.4 \\
3 &    0.2 \\
5 &    0.2 \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}

If you draw a random value from \passthrough{\lstinline!values!}, the
\passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} tells you the chance of getting
\passthrough{\lstinline!x!}, for any value of
\passthrough{\lstinline!x!}. So the probability of the value
\passthrough{\lstinline!1!} is \passthrough{\lstinline!1/5!}; the
probability of the value \passthrough{\lstinline!2!} is
\passthrough{\lstinline!2/5!}; and the probabilities for
\passthrough{\lstinline!3!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!5!} are
\passthrough{\lstinline!1/5!} each.

A CDF is similar to a PMF in the sense that it contains values and their
probabilities; the difference is that the probabilities in the CDF are
the cumulative sum of the probabilities in the PMF.

Here's a \passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} object for the same five values.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
Cdf.from_seq(values)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\midrule
{} &  probs \\
\midrule
1 &    0.2 \\
2 &    0.6 \\
3 &    0.8 \\
5 &    1.0 \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}

If you draw a random value from \passthrough{\lstinline!values!},
\passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} tells you the chance of getting a value
\emph{less than or equal to} \passthrough{\lstinline!x!}, for any given
\passthrough{\lstinline!x!}.

So the \passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} of \passthrough{\lstinline!1!} is
\passthrough{\lstinline!1/5!} because one of the five values in the
sequence is less than or equal to 1.

The \passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} of 2 is \passthrough{\lstinline!3/5!}
because three of the five values are less than or equal to 2.

And the \passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} of 5 is
\passthrough{\lstinline!5/5!} because all of the values are less than or
equal to 5.

\hypertarget{cdf-of-age}{%
\section{CDF of Age}\label{cdf-of-age}}

Now let's look at a more substantial \passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!}, the
distribution of ages for respondents in the General Social Survey.

The variable we'll use is \passthrough{\lstinline!'AGE'!}. According to
the codebook, the range of the values is from
\passthrough{\lstinline!18!} to \passthrough{\lstinline!89!}, where
\passthrough{\lstinline!89!} means ``89 or older''. The special codes
\passthrough{\lstinline!98!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!99!} mean
``Don't know'' and ``Didn't answer''. See
\url{https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/53/vshow}.

We can use \passthrough{\lstinline!replace!} to replace the special
codes with \passthrough{\lstinline!NaN!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
age = gss['AGE'].replace([98, 99], np.nan)
\end{lstlisting}

We can compute the \passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} of these values like
this:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
cdf_age = Cdf.from_seq(age)
\end{lstlisting}

\passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} provides a method called
\passthrough{\lstinline!plot!} that plots the CDF as a line. Here's what
it looks like.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
cdf_age.plot()

plt.xlabel('Age (years)')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.title('Distribution of age');
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_66_0.png}
\end{center}

The \(x\)-axis is the ages, from 18 to 89. The \(y\)-axis is the
cumulative probabilities, from 0 to 1.

\passthrough{\lstinline!cdf\_age!} can be used as a function, so if you
give it an age, it returns the corresponding probability (in a NumPy
array).

\begin{lstlisting}[]
q = 51
p = cdf_age(q)
p
(@\dashfill@)
@@@array(0.63318676)@@@
\end{lstlisting}

\passthrough{\lstinline!q!} stands for ``quantity'', which is what we
are looking up. \passthrough{\lstinline!p!} stands for probability,
which is the result. In this example, the quantity is age 51, and the
corresponding probability is about \passthrough{\lstinline!0.63!}. That
means that about 63\% of the respondents are 51 years old or younger.

The arrow in the following figure shows how you could read this value
from the CDF, at least approximately.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
cdf_age.plot()

x = 17
draw_line(p, q, x)
draw_arrow_left(p, q, x)

plt.xlabel('Age (years)')
plt.xlim(x-1, 91)
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.title('Distribution of age');
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_71_0.png}
\end{center}

The CDF is an invertible function, which means that if you have a
probability, \passthrough{\lstinline!p!}, you can look up the
corresponding quantity, \passthrough{\lstinline!q!}.
\passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} provides a method called
\passthrough{\lstinline!inverse!} that computes the inverse of the
cumulative distribution function.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
p1 = 0.25
q1 = cdf_age.inverse(p1)
q1
(@\dashfill@)
@@@array(31.)@@@
\end{lstlisting}

In this example, we look up the probability
\passthrough{\lstinline!0.25!} and the result is
\passthrough{\lstinline!31!}.\\
That means that 25\% of the respondents are age 31 or less. Another way
to say the same thing is ``age 31 is the 25th percentile of this
distribution''.

If we look up probability \passthrough{\lstinline!0.75!}, it returns
\passthrough{\lstinline!59!}, so 75\% of the respondents are 59 or
younger.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
p2 = 0.75
q2 = cdf_age.inverse(p2)
q2
(@\dashfill@)
@@@array(59.)@@@
\end{lstlisting}

In the following figure, the arrows show how you could read these values
from the CDF.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
cdf_age.plot()

x = 17
draw_line(p1, q1, x)
draw_arrow_down(p1, q1, 0)

draw_line(p2, q2, x)
draw_arrow_down(p2, q2, 0)

plt.xlabel('Age (years)')
plt.xlim(x-1, 91)
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.title('Distribution of age');
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_77_0.png}
\end{center}

The distance from the 25th to the 75th percentile is called the
\textbf{interquartile range}, or IQR. It measures the spread of the
distribution, so it is similar to standard deviation or variance.

Because it is based on percentiles, it doesn't get thrown off by extreme
values or outliers, the way standard deviation does. So IQR is more
\textbf{robust} than variance, which means it works well even if there
are errors in the data or extreme values.

\textbf{Exercise:} Using \passthrough{\lstinline!cdf\_age!}, compute the
fraction of the respondents in the GSS dataset that are \emph{older}
than 65.

\textbf{Exercise:} The distribution of income in almost every country is
long-tailed, which means there are a small number of people with very
high incomes. In the GSS dataset, the column
\passthrough{\lstinline!REALINC!} represents total household income,
converted to 1986 dollars. We can get a sense of the shape of this
distribution by plotting the CDF.

Select \passthrough{\lstinline!REALINC!} from the
\passthrough{\lstinline!gss!} dataset, make a
\passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!} called
\passthrough{\lstinline!cdf\_income!}, and plot it. Remember to label
the axes!

\hypertarget{comparing-distributions}{%
\section{Comparing Distributions}\label{comparing-distributions}}

So far we've seen two ways to represent distributions, PMFs and CDFs.
Now we'll use PMFs and CDFs to compare distributions, and we'll see the
pros and cons of each.

One way to compare distributions is to plot multiple PMFs on the same
axes. For example, suppose we want to compare the distribution of age
for male and female respondents.

First we'll create a Boolean Series that's true for male respondents.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
male = (gss['SEX'] == 1)
\end{lstlisting}

And another that's true for female respondents.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
female = (gss['SEX'] == 2)
\end{lstlisting}

Now we can select ages for the male and female respondents.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
male_age = age[male]
female_age = age[female]
\end{lstlisting}

And plot a PMF for each.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
pmf_male_age = Pmf.from_seq(male_age)
pmf_male_age.plot(label='Male')

pmf_female_age = Pmf.from_seq(female_age)
pmf_female_age.plot(label='Female')

plt.xlabel('Age (years)') 
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.title('Distribution of age by sex')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_88_0.png}
\end{center}

The plot is pretty noisy. In the range from 40 to 50, it looks like the
PMF is higher for men. And from 70 to 80, it is higher for women. But
both of those differences might be due to random variation.

Now let's do the same thing with CDFs; everything is the same except we
replace \passthrough{\lstinline!Pmf!} with
\passthrough{\lstinline!Cdf!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
cdf_male_age = Cdf.from_seq(male_age)
cdf_male_age.plot(label='Male')

cdf_female_age = Cdf.from_seq(female_age)
cdf_female_age.plot(label='Female')

plt.xlabel('Age (years)') 
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.title('Distribution of age by sex')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_90_0.png}
\end{center}

In general, CDFs are smoother than PMFs. Because they smooth out
randomness, we can often get a better view of real differences between
distributions. In this case, the lines are close together until age 40;
after that, the CDF is higher for men than women. So what does that
mean?

One way to interpret the difference is that the fraction of men below a
given age is generally more than the fraction of women below the same
age. For example, about 79\% of men are 60 or less, compared to 76\% of
women.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
cdf_male_age(60), cdf_female_age(60)
(@\dashfill@)
@@@(array(0.78599958), array(0.75529908))@@@
\end{lstlisting}

Going the other way, we could also compare percentiles. For example, the
median age woman is older than the median age man, by about one year.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
cdf_male_age.inverse(0.5), cdf_female_age.inverse(0.5)
(@\dashfill@)
@@@(array(43.), array(44.))@@@
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Exercise:} What fraction of men are over 80? What fraction of
women?

\hypertarget{comparing-incomes}{%
\section{Comparing Incomes}\label{comparing-incomes}}

As another example, let's look at household income and compare the
distribution before and after 1995 (I chose 1995 because it's roughly
the midpoint of the survey). The variable
\passthrough{\lstinline!REALINC!} represents household income in 1986
dollars.

We'll make a Boolean \passthrough{\lstinline!Series!} to select
respondents interviewed before and after 1995.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
pre95 = (gss['YEAR'] < 1995)
post95 = (gss['YEAR'] >= 1995)
\end{lstlisting}

Now we can plot the PMFs.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
income = gss['REALINC'].replace(0, np.nan)

Pmf.from_seq(income[pre95]).plot(label='Before 1995')
Pmf.from_seq(income[post95]).plot(label='After 1995')

plt.xlabel('Income (1986 USD)')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.title('Distribution of income')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_99_0.png}
\end{center}

There are a lot of unique values in this distribution, and none of them
appear very often. As a result, the PMF is so noisy and we can't really
see the shape of the distribution.

It's also hard to compare the distributions. It looks like there are
more people with high incomes after 1995, but it's hard to tell. We can
get a clearer picture with a CDF.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
Cdf.from_seq(income[pre95]).plot(label='Before 1995')
Cdf.from_seq(income[post95]).plot(label='After 1995')

plt.xlabel('Income (1986 USD)')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.title('Distribution of income')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_101_0.png}
\end{center}

Below \$30,000 the CDFs are almost identical; above that, we can see
that the post-1995 distribution is shifted to the right. In other words,
the fraction of people with high incomes is about the same, but the
income of high earners has increased.

In general, I recommend CDFs for exploratory analysis. They give you a
clear view of the distribution, without too much noise, and they are
good for comparing distributions, especially if you have more than two.

\textbf{Exercise:} In the previous figure, the dollar amounts are big
enough that the labels on the \passthrough{\lstinline!x!} axis are
crowded. Improve the figure by expressing income in 1000s of dollars
(and update the \passthrough{\lstinline!x!} label accordingly).

\textbf{Exercise:} Let's compare incomes for different levels of
education in the GSS dataset

To do that we'll create Boolean \passthrough{\lstinline!Series!} to
identify respondents with different levels of education.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the U.S, 12 years of education usually means the respondent has
  completed high school (secondary education).
\item
  A respondent with 14 years of education has probably completed an
  associate degree (two years of college)
\item
  Someone with 16 years has probably completed a bachelor's degree (four
  years of college or university).
\end{itemize}

Define Boolean \passthrough{\lstinline!Series!} named
\passthrough{\lstinline!high!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!assc!}, and
\passthrough{\lstinline!bach!} that are true for respondents with

\begin{itemize}
\item
  12 or fewer years of education,
\item
  13, 14, or 15 years, and
\item
  16 or more.
\end{itemize}

Compute and plot the distribution of income for each group. Remember to
label the CDFs, display a legend, and label the axes. Write a few
sentences that describe and interpret the results.

\hypertarget{modeling-distributions}{%
\section{Modeling Distributions}\label{modeling-distributions}}

Some distributions have names. For example, you might be familiar with
the normal distribution, also called the Gaussian distribution or the
bell curve. And you might have heard of others like the exponential
distribution, binomial distribution, or maybe Poisson distribution.

These ``distributions with names'' are called \textbf{analytic} because
they are described by analytic mathematical functions, as contrasted
with empirical distributions, which are based on data.

It turns out that many things we measure in the world have distributions
that are well approximated by analytic distributions, so these
distributions are sometimes good models for the real world.\\
In this context, what I mean by a ``model'' is a simplified description
of the world that is accurate enough for its intended purpose.

In this section, we'll compute the CDF of a normal distribution and
compare it to an empirical distribution of data. But before we get to
real data, we'll start with fake data.

The following statement uses NumPy's \passthrough{\lstinline!random!}
library to generate 1000 values from a normal distribution with mean
\passthrough{\lstinline!0!} and standard deviation
\passthrough{\lstinline!1!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
np.random.seed(17)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[]
sample = np.random.normal(size=1000)
\end{lstlisting}

Here's what the empirical distribution of the sample looks like.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
cdf_sample = Cdf.from_seq(sample)
cdf_sample.plot(label='Random sample')

plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_109_0.png}
\end{center}

If we did not know that this sample was drawn from a normal
distribution, and we wanted to check, we could compare the CDF of the
data to the CDF of an ideal normal distribution, which we can use the
SciPy library to compute.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
from scipy.stats import norm

xs = np.linspace(-3, 3)
ys = norm(0, 1).cdf(xs)
\end{lstlisting}

First we import \passthrough{\lstinline!norm!} from
\passthrough{\lstinline!scipy.stats!}, which is a collection of
functions related to statistics.

Then we use \passthrough{\lstinline!linspace()!} to create an array of
equally-spaced points from -3 to 3; those are the
\passthrough{\lstinline!x!} values where we will evaluate the normal
CDF.

Next, \passthrough{\lstinline!norm(0, 1)!} creates an object that
represents a normal distribution with mean \passthrough{\lstinline!0!}
and standard deviation \passthrough{\lstinline!1!}.

Finally, \passthrough{\lstinline!cdf!} computes the CDF of the normal
distribution, evaluated at each of the \passthrough{\lstinline!xs!}.

I'll plot the normal CDF with a gray line and then plot the CDF of the
data again.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray', label='Normal CDF')
cdf_sample.plot(label='Random sample')

plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_113_0.png}
\end{center}

The CDF of the random sample agrees with the normal model. And that's
not surprising because the data were actually sampled from a normal
distribution. When we collect data in the real world, we do not expect
it to fit a normal distribution as well as this. In the next exercise,
we'll try it and see.

\textbf{Exercise:} Is the normal distribution a good model for the
distribution of ages in the U.S. population?

To answer this question:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Compute the mean and standard deviation of ages in the GSS dataset.
\item
  Use \passthrough{\lstinline!linspace!} to create an array of equally
  spaced values between 18 and 89.
\item
  Use \passthrough{\lstinline!norm!} to create a normal distribution
  with the same mean and standard deviation as the data, then use it to
  compute the normal CDF for each value in the array.
\item
  Plot the normal CDF with a gray line.
\item
  Plot the CDF of the ages in the GSS.
\end{itemize}

How well do the plotted CDFs agree?

\textbf{Exercise:} In many datasets, the distribution of income is
approximately \textbf{lognormal}, which means that the logarithms of the
incomes fit a normal distribution. Let's see whether that's true for the
GSS data.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Extract \passthrough{\lstinline!REALINC!} from
  \passthrough{\lstinline!gss!} and compute its logarithm using
  \passthrough{\lstinline!np.log10()!}. Hint: Replace the value
  \passthrough{\lstinline!0!} with \passthrough{\lstinline!NaN!} before
  computing logarithms.
\item
  Compute the mean and standard deviation of the log-transformed
  incomes.
\item
  Use \passthrough{\lstinline!norm!} to make a normal distribution with
  the same mean and standard deviation as the log-transformed incomes.
\item
  Plot the CDF of the normal distribution.
\item
  Compute and plot the CDF of the log-transformed incomes.
\end{itemize}

How similar are the CDFs of the log-transformed incomes and the normal
distribution?

\hypertarget{kernel-density-estimation}{%
\section{Kernel Density Estimation}\label{kernel-density-estimation}}

We have seen two ways to represent distributions, PMFs and CDFs. Now
we'll learn another way: a probability density function, or PDF. The
\passthrough{\lstinline!norm!} function, which we used to compute the
normal CDF, can also compute the normal PDF:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
xs = np.linspace(-3, 3)
ys = norm(0,1).pdf(xs)
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray', label='Normal PDF')

plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.title('Normal density function')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_118_0.png}
\end{center}

The normal PDF is the classic ``bell curve''.

It is tempting to compare the PMF of the data to the PDF of the normal
distribution, but that doesn't work. Let's see what happens if we try:

\begin{lstlisting}[]
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray', label='Normal PDF')

pmf_sample = Pmf.from_seq(sample)
pmf_sample.plot(label='Random sample')

plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.title('Normal density function')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_120_0.png}
\end{center}

The PMF of the sample is a flat line across the bottom. In the random
sample, every value is unique, so they all have the same probability,
one in 1000.

However, we can use the points in the sample to estimate the PDF of the
distribution they came from. This process is called \textbf{kernel
density estimation}, or KDE. It's a way of getting from a PMF, a
probability mass function, to a PDF, a probability density function.

To generate a KDE plot, we'll use the Seaborn library, imported as
\passthrough{\lstinline!sns!}. Seaborn provides
\passthrough{\lstinline!kdeplot!}, which takes the sample, estimates the
PDF, and plots it.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
import seaborn as sns

sns.kdeplot(sample, label='Estimated sample PDF')

plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.title('Normal density function')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_122_0.png}
\end{center}

Now we can compare the KDE plot and the normal PDF.

\begin{lstlisting}[]
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray', label='Normal PDF')
sns.kdeplot(sample, label='Estimated sample PDF')

plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.title('Normal density function')
plt.legend();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{chapters/08_distributions_files/08_distributions_124_0.png}
\end{center}

The KDE plot matches the normal PDF pretty well, although the
differences look bigger when we compare PDFs than they did with the
CDFs. That means that the PDF is a more sensitive way to look for
differences, but often it is too sensitive.\\
It's hard to tell whether apparent differences mean anything, or if they
are just random, as in this case.

\textbf{Exercise:} In a previous exercise, we asked ``Is the normal
distribution a good model for the distribution of ages in the U.S.
population?'' To answer this question, we plotted the CDF of the data
and compared it to the CDF of a normal distribution with the same mean
and standard deviation.

Now we'll compare the estimated density of the data with the normal PDF.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Again, compute the mean and standard deviation of ages in the GSS
  dataset.
\item
  Use \passthrough{\lstinline!linspace!} to create an array of values
  between 18 and 89.
\item
  Use \passthrough{\lstinline!norm!} to create a normal distribution
  with the same mean and standard deviation as the data, then use it to
  compute the normal PDF for each value in the array.
\item
  Plot the normal PDF with a gray line.
\item
  Use \passthrough{\lstinline!sns.kdeplot!} to estimate and plot the
  density of the ages in the GSS.
\end{itemize}

Note: Seaborn can't handle NaNs, so use \passthrough{\lstinline!dropna!}
to drop them before calling \passthrough{\lstinline!kdeplot!}.

How well do the PDF and KDE plots agree?

\textbf{Exercise:} In a previous exercise, we used CDFs to see if the
distribution of income fits a lognormal distribution. We can make the
same comparison using a PDF and KDE.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Again, extract \passthrough{\lstinline!REALINC!} from
  \passthrough{\lstinline!gss!} and compute its logarithm using
  \passthrough{\lstinline!np.log10()!}.
\item
  Compute the mean and standard deviation of the log-transformed
  incomes.
\item
  Use \passthrough{\lstinline!norm!} to make a normal distribution with
  the same mean and standard deviation as the log-transformed incomes.
\item
  Plot the PDF of the normal distribution.
\item
  Use \passthrough{\lstinline!sns.kdeplot()!} to estimate and plot the
  density of the log-transformed incomes.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

In this chapter, we've seen four ways to visualize distributions, PMFs,
CDFs, and KDE plots.

In general, I use CDFs when I am exploring data. That way, I get the
best view of what's going on without getting distracted by noise.

Then, if I am presenting results to an audience unfamiliar with CDFs, I
might use a PMF if the dataset contains a small number of unique values,
or KDE if there are many unique values.
